 <h1 class="display-4">About Name, Image & Likeness (NIL)</h1>
 <p class="lead">Name, image and likeness are the three elements that make up the right of publicity. </p>
<p> </p>
  <p class="lead">According to the Legal Information Institute, "the right of publicity prevents the unauthorized commercial use of an individual's name, likeness, or other recognizable aspects of one's persona. It gives an individual the exclusive right to license the use of their identity for commercial promotion." </p>

  <h1 class="display-4">How does it related to college athletics?</h1>
  <p class="lead">In June 2021, the NCAA passed interim legislation that allows college athletes to benefit from their own NIL. This means they can earn money through advertisements and sponsorshops, running clinics and businesses as well as autographs and memorabilia. </p>
<p> </p>
    <p class="lead">Before this interim legislation was passed, some states were working on passing their own.</p>

These NIL guidelines apply to all student-athletes participating in intercollegiate athletic programs at the University of Maryland and establish clear expectations surrounding a student-athleteâ€™s involvement in permissible NIL activities. Furthermore, these NIL guidelines apply to prospective high school and transfer student-athletes who may attend the University of Maryland.</p>

<p class="lead"> <div id="word">STUDENT-ATHLETE NAME, IMAGE, LIKENESS GUIDELINES</div>
Under Maryland law, and in accordance with NCAA rules, the following name, image, likeness guidelines are applicable to University of Maryland student-athletes:</p>
