 <h1 class="display-4">About name, image & likeness (NIL)</h1>
 <p class="lead">Name, image and likeness are the three elements that make up right of publicity </p>
<p> </p>
  <p class="lead">According to the Legal Information Institute, "the right of publicity prevents the unauthorized commercial use of an individual's name, likeness, or other recognizable aspects of one's persona. It gives an individual the exclusive right to license the use of their identity for commercial promotion." </p>

  <h1 class="display-4">How does it related to collge athletics?</h1>
  <p class="lead">In June 2021, the NCAA passed interim legislation that allows college athletes to benefit from their own NIL. This means they can earn money through advertisements and sponsorshops, running clinics and businesses as well as autographs and memorabilia. </p>
<p> </p>
    <p class="lead">Before this interim legislation was passed, some states were working on passing their own.</p>

The tracker listed the athlete, their sport, the company and the date/platform in which they announced the news. The tracker also included a column for any other significant information such as "First non-football athlete" By Lauren Rosh, Testudo Times </p>
